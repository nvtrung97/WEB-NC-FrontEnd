# Camp-k12 ReactJs Assignment

> The assignment is deployed at https://thisshri.github.io/react-online-course/#/online-courses
### Note
* Responsive design including Navbar
* I have created a route for "Online Courses", "Offline Camps" and "Refer & Earn" so the active nav button is also dynamic.
* The cards used are dynamic, values shown in them are being passed through props.
* The three grade buttons "GRADE 1-4", "GRADE 5-8", and "GRADE 9-12" also work.
* fields/ information like, Batches, hours and sessions and discounts etc in the course card is dynamic.
